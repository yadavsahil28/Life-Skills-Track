## Good Practices for Software Development

### **Question 1: Which point(s) were new to you?**

- The emphasis on keeping the video on during meetings for better team rapport was a new perspective. Many developers prefer keeping their cameras off, but I can see how it helps in improving communication.
- The idea of joining meetings 5-10 minutes early to build relationships with teammates was also a great takeaway.

### **Question 2: Which area do you think you need to improve on? What are your ideas to make progress in that area?**

- **Over-communication**: I sometimes assume people will figure things out on their own, but proactively updating teammates about progress or blockers can prevent misunderstandings. I can improve by making it a habit to post regular updates in team channels.
- **Deep Work & Focus**: I already try to minimize distractions, but I could experiment with using tools like Freedom or Boosted to track work sessions more efficiently. Also, maintaining an exercise routine would be beneficial for sustained energy.
